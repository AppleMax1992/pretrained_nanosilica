Code and data for Boosting Pretrained model with Amorphous Silica Nanoparticles Cellular Toxicity Identification
1. Main_Indepedent_Dataset.csv is the main file with all the features, we used this as our main dataset to train,val, and test
2. Main_Indepedent_Dataset_COLAB.csv is the file with selected features refered from Evidence-based prediction of cellular toxicity for amorphous silica nanoparticles, we used this to do the fair comparison with previous methods.
3. The notebooks are used for reproduce our experiments including our methods and all the comparison methods.

1. Download the Main_Independent_Dataset_COLAB.csv by running the first line of code (PLEASE WAIT until the file has been downloaded)
2. Then, create your new samples of silica nanoparticles in Main_Independent_Dataset_COLAB.csv with Publication_id = 150 (we provided two examples)
3. PLEASE UPLOAD the new file (Main_Independent_Dataset_COLAB.csv) containing your new samples of silica nanoparticles by running the second line of code
4. Predict your new samples of silica nanoparticles by running the third line of code, and PLEASE WAIT until the results have been downloaded 
5. Decision-making rationality of your new samples can be obtained by running the last line of code
